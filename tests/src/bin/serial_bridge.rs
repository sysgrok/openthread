//! The HIL tier's node: a device running the `openthread` stack as *firmware*,
//! reached over its serial console.
//!
//! This binary is what `OT_CLI_PATH` points at for that tier. It is not a node
//! itself - it owns no stack and no radio. It maps the node id the harness
//! spawns it with to a serial device, and then gets out of the way, piping
//! stdin to the device and the device's output back to stdout. The harness
//! cannot tell the difference between this and a node that runs in-process,
//! which is the whole trick: the same unmodified upstream scenarios drive
//! firmware on real silicon.
//!
//! ```text
//!   harness --spawns--> serial_bridge <node id>
//!                          |  stdin/stdout
//!                          +--serial--> [MCU: openthread + CLI + NrfRadio/EspRadio]
//!                                                    ~)) real RF
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this tier exists
//!
//! The RCP tier (see [`openthread_tests::hw`]) puts real RF under the
//! stack, but the radio it drives is a co-processor running someone else's
//! firmware, and the stack still runs on a host. This tier is the only one
//! where the crate's own radio drivers (`NrfRadio`, `EspRadio`, or any
//! user-provided `Radio`), the `MacRadio` software MAC with its real ACK
//! deadlines, and the `ProxyRadio` executor split all run where they are meant
//! to - on the MCU, against a real clock.
//!
//! # Port map
//!
//! The same `OT_HW_PORTS` map as the RCP tier, with the same
//! `<device>[@<baud>]` syntax, indexed by node id. A rig may mix the two tiers
//! freely - the `xtask` decides which binary to spawn per node - and mixing is
//! usually what you want: pairing the device under test against a known-good
//! RCP node isolates a failure to the device.
//!
//! # Fresh state
//!
//! The suites assume a factory-fresh node per test. A host node gets that for
//! free (a new process); firmware does not, since the device has been running
//! since the last test. So on startup the bridge issues the reset command in
//! `OT_HW_RESET_CMD` (default `factoryreset`, the CLI's own wipe-and-restart)
//! and waits for the prompt to come back. Set it empty to skip - useful when
//! attaching to a device mid-run to watch it.
//!
//! # Devices that come and go
//!
//! On a board whose console is its own USB peripheral (a XIAO nRF52840, say),
//! a chip reset takes the console down with it: the device drops off the bus
//! and re-enumerates a moment later. The harness neither knows nor cares - it
//! sent `reset` and keeps talking to the same bridge - so the bridge absorbs
//! the gap: when the device side errors, it reopens the device path (same
//! `by-id` symlink, fresh tty) and carries on. Whatever the harness writes
//! meanwhile waits in the bridge's stdin pipe rather than being lost, because
//! the bridge only reads stdin while it has a device to forward to. Only a
//! device that stays gone past [`RECONNECT_TIMEOUT`] ends the bridge - and
//! with it, visibly, the test.
